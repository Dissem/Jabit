  \section{Synopsis}



  % Section basics
  \input{basics}

  The protocol is described in detail in my Seminar paper.


  \section{Goal}

  At the moment, there aren't many implementations apart from the official clients. Especially two things are missing: a multi purpose Java library and a usable mobile client. My goal for my \textit{Project 2} is to create the library, to be used next semester as a starting point for an Android\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} client in my Bachelor Thesis.


  \section{Issues}

  \subsection{Proof of Work}

  Proof of work is needed for a message to be distributed within the Bitmessage network. This is to protect both the network itself from denial of service attacks and the users from spam.


  \section{Architecture}

  \subsection{Ports and Adapters}

  The library uses a ports and adapters architecture, which allows us to easily replace some implementations that might be platform dependent, such as storage or proof of work calculation.

  The big advantage of this approach is that it's easy to test the core as well as each adapter by itself.
